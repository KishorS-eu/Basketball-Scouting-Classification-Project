# Basketball-Scouting-Classification-Project
Project Files for my first year programming project, an accompaniment to the poster I produced

We have two csv files, one that has the original data set, and the other which has the data set after applying PCA to it
We also have two R files, the PCA file which helped us generate the second data-set, and the classifiers file that contains
the code that I used to classify the data.
